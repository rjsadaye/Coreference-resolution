Right now we have X (input) to the model a dataset of n x 50 dimensions.
Y is one-hot representation of the classes.

THINGS THAT WILL CHANGE:
1. Need to add another class as None
2. The input file that will be passed to the model needs to be chunked into phrases.
3. These phrases need to be converted into vectors 
4. These vectors will be passed to the model to get the corresponding class for each phrase
5. Output should be a phrase, class file
